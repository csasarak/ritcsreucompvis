In order to run the code in this repository you need to have two libraries in your path:
JAI – which can be found at this location:

https://jai.dev.java.net/

And Bij (which requires ImageJ, but this is included in one of the archives) – which can be found at this location:

http://big.isi.uu.nl/

To run the program on an image simply run “java ImageProcessor ” supplying that image’s filename at the command line. A list of images can also be given and the classifications will be printed out to stdout.
